# Welcome to the Toronto Metropolitan University CSCU Wiki

We are Toronto Metropolitan Universityâ€™s Computer Science Course Union (CSCU). We represent all full time undergraduate computer science students at TMU in the computer science department. We also host plenty of academic, career, and social events.

<!-- # Introduction

## Welcome to Toronto Metropolitan University's Department of Computer Science

The Department of Computer Science is located on the second floor of the Center for Computing and Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University. We have five labs; ENG206 is an open lab that students always have access to because no courses are booked there. For more information regarding the DCS computer labs, refer to sub-section Lab Information under section "Introduction to DCS Computing Facilities". This guide is designed to introduce you to the diverse academic computing resources available to you as a student of the Department of Computer Science (DCS).

## ACS (Academic Computing Services) and DCS (Department of Computer Science)

Computing and Communications Services (CCS) is TMU's central information technology department, providing computing resources for TMU as a whole. Academic Computing Services (ACS) is a division of CCS. All Toronto Met students are given an ACS e-mail account in the form of login-id@torontomu.ca. UNIX accounts on servers such as turing, malthus and so on, are assigned as required. While CCS operates over 300 networked microcomputers and workstations in its labs, DCS operates its own labs independently. The Department of Computer Science can be found on the second floor of the Centre for Computer and Engineering at Toronto Met University. For more information about DCS Computing facilities, see the Introduction to DCS Computing Facilities.

## Where to Get Help

If you have a question which is not answered by this User's Guide, you should consult the User's Guide to Academic Computing and the Internet which is full of useful information about most of the computing facilities available throughout all of TMU. If you would like to book a lab or want to get some additional information about our Facilities, please email request@cs.torontomu.ca . If there is a problem with the hardware in one of our labs, first make sure that everything is plugged in properly. If this doesn't solve the problem then please email request@cs.torontomu.ca and include a detailed description of the problem, including which room and machine (eg. "The mouse is broken on PC ENG206-42" or "The monitor won't turn on at ENG201-15"). If there is a problem with the software or network, ask around to see if anyone else can help you. If that doesn't work, please contact one of the System Administrators. Mail can be sent to request@cs.torontomu.ca to report hardware or software problems, or to request new services. -->
